# project
INTRODUCTION 
The website of the AITU dormitory, "Dormitory news" shows announcements and news about the dorm. The project is relevant, as important messages in telegram channels are lost and many remain unaware of useful information.

MAIN PART (Practical) | Information about developers and their responsibilities.
For the first task, each member of the group had their own responsibilities, The idea of creating a news site was suggested by Arthur and for the disclosure of ideas he was the author. Daniel took on the role of creative director and took up the color palette and design. Zhalgas, in turn, became a lead designer and engaged in the search for photos and, strictly speaking, design.
For the second task, we had a template website that we could continue working with. To begin with, after studying bootstrap, we ran through the source code and began to change everything that could be changed, changed the classes of some elements, generally experimented a lot and made the site more convenient and functional. In addition, 2 pages were added, "contacts" and "registration".
